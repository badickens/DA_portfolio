                        <h4>Analysis of The Movie Database (TMDb) has resulted in the following findings:</h4>
                        <p>This investigation focused on the most detailed attributes available in the dataset - actors, directors, and genres that could still gleam potentially interesting information. Note: No other sources were used to verify or suppliment the data from the TMDb dataset.
                        </p>
                        <p>There were some limitations on the scope of this analysis during the exploration of the dataset. This included missing actual revenues values, and missing production company references. Production company information was not included among the detailed attributes since there was too much missing to deem it useful for comparison. Overall, half of the information per movie was for those released between 2006 and 2015.
                            The following cursory observations were made during this investigation:
