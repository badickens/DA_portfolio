							<p>I'm an experienced product development engineer transitioning into a career as a Data Analyst.
							My goal is to focus more on the operations and decision components required for any business marketplace
							that wants to successfully meet consumer needs. Eventhough my path to data analysis has not been 
							a straight line, I have absolutely valued my time in the process. Having other jobs and gaps in 
							employment have allowed me to rekindle my missed joy for the learning process.</p>

							<p>Previously as an engineer, I worked extensively with cross-functional teams for the design and
							development of consumer products. As a Project/Design Engineer, I successfully managed and
							delivered to market several key products and upgrades used in the Pool/Spa Industry.  I performed
							all aspects of new product design, development, and production, which included Engineering Project
							Management, Engineering Design/Development, Integration/Unit Testing, Product Manager support,
							Manufacturing/Production support, Supply Chain Development, Product Technical Training, and
							development of Quality Assurance requirements.</p>
							
							<p>My experience at being preemptive during project development had proven to be the path to meeting 
							company goals. Gaining valuable insights is crucial to parsing out the detailed processes in order 
							to fulfill the project requirements.

							<p>Self-driven training and education are core to my personal improvement and continuous acquisition of
							data analytics and statistics knowledge. Skills I developed through engineering are transferable to the 
							responsibilities of a data analyst. I would be an asset to any data analysis team due to my attention to detail, 
							analytical approach, creativity, and ability to adapt and learn new skills.</p>
							
							<p>My work experience has allowed me to develop the 5 core skills for data-driven analysis:</p>
							
							<ol id="DA_core_skills">
								<li><span class="core_5">Curiosity</span> - Why I went into Engineering in the first place.</li>
								<li><span class="core_5">Understanding context</span> - Being able to see overall project requirements not specifically noted.</li>
								<li><span class="core_5">Having a technical mindset</span> - A requirement as an Engineer.</li>
								<li><span class="core_5">Data design</span> - Not just for databases, also from my experience acquired when designing intuitive user interfaces.</li>
								<li><span class="core_5">Data strategy</span> - This incorporates the people, processes, and tools used to solve a problem. Data strategy gives you a high level view of the path
								    you will need to take to achieve your goals.</li>
							</ol>
							
							<p>I look forward to adding my skills to an organization who values hard work, dedication, and the art of data analysis.
							
							<p>Sincerely,</p>
							
							<p>Bridget Dickens</p>
